KA KA KA METTA SUTTA To reach the state of peace Those skilled in the Good Should be Capable and upright, Straightforward and easy to speak to, Gentle and not proud, Contented and easily supported, Living lightly and with few duties, Wise and with senses calmed, Not arrogant and without greed for supporters, And they should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize. They should reflect: 'May all be happy and secure; May all beings be happy at heart. All living beings, whether weak or strong, Tall, large, medium, or short, Tiny or big, Seen or unseen, Near or distant, Born or to be born, May they all be happy.' Let no one deceive another Or despise anyone anywhere; Let no one through anger or aversion Wish for others to suffer. As a mother would risk her own life To protect her child, her only child, So toward all beings should one Cultivate a boundless heart. With loving-kindness for the whole world Should one cultivate a boundless heart, Above, below, and all around Without obstruction, without hate and without ill-will. Standing or walking, sitting or lying down, As long as one is alert, May one stay with this recollection. This is called a sublime abiding, here and now. Whoever is virtuous, endowed with vision, Not taken by views, And having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure Will not be reborn again. SK SK SK
