ReaJS will look in your REAPER directory if present, otherwise JS root path needs to be in JS\

If a reajs.ini is present (or if you copy reajs.dll to reajs_whatever.dll, 
then reajs_whatever.ini), you can specify the following 
(all fields are optional):

--CUT--
[ReaJS]
rootpath=JS ; can be absolute path, relative path (relative to reajs.dll), or 
            ; begin with a \ to be relative to current drive -- note this 
            ; isnt the path to effects directly, but a dir that should have 
            ; data\ and effects\ subdirectories... the default is simply "JS" 
            ; (if reaper isnt installed)

appendname=/blah  ; makes effect called "ReaJS/blah"

; vstid=602358 ; default is CCONST('rejs') but if your host demands 
                        ; it you can pick your own (good luck not colliding)

defaulteffect=someeffectname ; loads this effect (without path!) by default

; defaulteffect=!someeffectname ; loads this effect, and doesnt allow user to 
                                ; switch to other effects!

vstcat=1   ; 1 = effect, 2= "synth", others, see vst sdk

preventedit=0 ; set to 1 to disable editing ui

inputs=2    ; number of audio inputs (0-64)

outputs=2    ; number of audio outputs (0-64)

midiflags=3  ; 0 = no midi send/recv, 1=recv midi from host, 
             ; 2=send midi to host, 3=both



the end.
