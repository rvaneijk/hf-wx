University of Illinois Listserver for Marine Applications

Note:  The following provided information does not imply any  
endorsement by the National Weather Service as to function or 
suitability for your purpose or environment.  

These Lists provide an automated means to receive NWS hurricane 
forecast products via e-mail.  However, performance may vary and 
receipt cannot be guaranteed by either UIUC or the National Weather 
Service  

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) operates an 
e-mail Listserver of which two Lists, WX-ATLAN, and WX-TROPL are of 
special interest to mariners who do not have direct access to the 
World Wide Web but who are equipped with an e-mail system.  These 
Lists provide an automated means to receive hurricane information 
via e-mail.  Information on this system may be found at: 
https://lists.illinois.edu/lists/help/introduction

Users should be aware of the costs for operating their particular 
e-mail system before attempting to use this List server, especially 
when using satellite communication systems.  Although the service is 
free, the user is responsible for any charges associated with the 
communication system(s) used by their e-mail system.  As this 
List server will send requested data on a continuous basis until 
service is successfully terminated, potential charges might be 
significant. 

As a general guide, National Weather Service hurricane products 
average 1 Kbyte each in length.  The tropical weather OUTLOOK is 
transmitted on a 6 hour cycle during the hurricane season. Other 
products are transmitted when active systems exist, on a 6 hour cycle 
(one series of products for each storm).  Products may be transmitted 
more often as the systems approach landfall, to make corrections, etc. 
The Lists may contain products in addition to those produced by the 
National Weather Service. 

This List server is not operated or maintained by the National Weather 
Service, please direct all questions to Chris Novy cnovy@cox.net

National Weather Service hurricane products may also be found on 
the World Wide Web at links including:
