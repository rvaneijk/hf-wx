     Marine Forecasts and Related Information Available via E-mail 


National Weather Service (and other) marine forecasts are available via 
a variety of Government, University, Commercial and Public/Freeware 
systems intended to make information accessible to users such as mariners 
who may have an e-mail capability but do not have direct Internet access.  
The following is a listing of several known automated systems.

Note:  Any reference to any product or service does not imply any 
endorsement by the National Weather Service as to function or suitability 
for your purpose or environment.

>>>>FTPMAIL<<<<

**** IMPORTANT NOTICES ****

Effective September 07, 2016, the address of the FTPMAIL service changed 
from ftpmail@ftpmail.nws.noaa.gov to NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov.  
If you restrict incoming e-mail as a means of preventing spam, you must
configure your e-mail system to allow mail from NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov 

Read the help file carefully - 99% of errors using FTPMAIL are simple 
typo's, incorrect capitalization, failure to send in plain text format, 
leading or trailing spaces, or failure to set up any spam filters properly.  
 
These instructions are subject to revision....download frequently.
 
 
National Weather Service marine text forecasts and radiofax charts are 
available via e-mail via an FTPMAIL server.  Further, FTPMAIL may be used 
to acquire any file on the tgftp.nws.noaa.gov FTP server. The FTPMAIL server 
is intended to allow Internet access for mariners and other users who do not 
have direct access to the World Wide Web but who are equipped with an e-mail 
system.  Turnaround is generally less than one hour, however, performance 
may vary widely and receipt cannot be guaranteed. To get started in using the 
NWS FTPMAIL service, follow these simple directions to obtain the FTPMAIL 
"help" file (11 KBytes), or see   http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/fax/ftpmail.txt

>>>>NOAA/NWS Products Not Available via FTPMAIL<<<<
Not all NWS forecast products are available via FTP and therefore 
accessible via FTPMAIL such as worldwide computer generated model 
forecasts which include areas beyond the area of U.S. forecasting 
responsibility such as the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic.

and other forecasts via e-mail, use one of the www-to-email systems 
such as SAILDOCS or OTHERS described below.  Be aware computer generated 
products from forecast models are not reviewed by forecasters and are 
therefore subject to error. E.G. per the Wave Watch III webpage:

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign operates an e-mail 
listserver of which two Lists, WX-ATLAN, and WX-TROPL are of special 
interest to mariners who do not have direct access to the World Wide Web 
but who are equipped with an e-mail system. These Lists provide an 
automated means to receive NWS hurricane (and some marine) forecast 
products via e-mail. However, performance may vary and receipt cannot be 
guaranteed. To get started in using the University of Illinois 
Listserver, follow these simple directions to obtain further information,

SAILDOCS is an email-based document-retrieval system which currently 
offers two services: a document retrieval service which will return 
documents from the Internet or SAILDOCS own files, and a subscription 
service which will send Internet documents (for example weather reports) 
at scheduled intervals.  SAILDOCS files include National Weather Service 
text forecasts and gridded binary (GRIB files) for wind, pressure, 500mb, 
and sea surface temperature.  SAILDOCS is supported in part by Sailmail 
(www.sailmail.com) but is an independent service that can be used by 
anyone who agrees to the terms and conditions. To get started in using 
SAILDOCS, follow these simple directions to obtain further information,

"Entire NtM". Graphics provided in this version are inadequate 
for navigation purposes. Navigation-quality chartlets are available 
for download on the MSI website as needed.

is selected, an e-mail window is generated with the "To" and "From" 
addresses filled out. The "Subject" and "Body" will be blank. 
Selecting "Send" subscribes the user to the e-mailed Notice to Mariners.
* Instructions to unsubscribe from the notice are included in each Notice 
to Mariners e-mail.
