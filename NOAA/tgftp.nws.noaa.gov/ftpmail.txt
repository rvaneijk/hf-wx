**** IMPORTANT NOTICES **** Read these notes carefully ****

These instructions are subject to revision....download frequently.

Effective September 07, 2016, the address of the FTPMAIL service changed 
from ftpmail@ftpmail.nws.noaa.gov to NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov  

If you restrict incoming e-mail as a means of preventing spam, you must
configure your e-mail system to allow mail from  NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov. 

99% of errors using ftpmail are simple typing errors, incorrect capitalization, 
failure to send in plain text format, leading or trailing spaces, or failure to 
set up any spam filters properly.  See section on ensuring e-mail 
requests are sent in the proper format and follow the examples closely.

Check time and date of forecasts. Downloaded data may not 
represent the latest forecast. The Internet is not part of the 
National Weather Service's operational data stream and should never 
be relied upon as a means to obtain the latest forecast and warning 
data. Become familiar with and use other means such as NOAA Weather 
Radio to obtain the latest forecasts and warnings. Please read our 
disclaimer at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/disclaimer.php

Radiofax .TIF files now also available as (larger) .gif files

ftp://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/ is the only valid FTP site for this service.

This "help" file contains a detailed description of the FTPMAIL system 
and available products. To obtain another copy of the FTPMAIL "help" file:

-In plain text format-
Send an e-mail to:       NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov
Subject Line:            Put anything you like
Body:                    help

  
This National Weather Service (NWS) FTPMAIL server is intended to
allow Internet access for users who do not have direct access to
the World Wide Web but who are equipped with an e-mail system. 
The service is free and no signup is required.  Using FTPMAIL,
users can request files from NWS and have them automatically
e-mailed back to them.  Turnaround is generally less than one
hour, however, performance may vary widely and the NWS cannot guarantee 
receipt. 

Although these instructions are tailored for marine users to gain
access to graphic (radiofax) and text products via e-mail, all
publicly available data on the NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov Internet FTP 
server is accessible using the FTPMAIL service.  

To begin using the FTPMAIL service, the user sends a small script file via 
e-mail requesting the desired file(s). A list of available product
directories and file names can be seen by clicking the link below.

http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/fax/

A listing of all available product descriptions, file names, times the product 
is available and issuing center can be viewed at the link below. It will help 
you determine which products you want/need to receive using FTPMAIL.

*ENSURING YOUR E-MAIL IS IN THE PROPER FORMAT*

FTPMAIL e-mail requests must be sent in ASCII/Plain Text only. 
 
HTML formatting will likely result in no response from the FTPMAIL
server. 

An FAQ webpage describing several public and commercial FTP-to-EMAIL 
and WWW-to-EMAIL servers may be found at: 
www.faqs.org/faqs/internet-services/access-via-email/

Users should be familiar with sending and receiving messages and
attachments with their particular e-mail system.  Attachments are
received in UUencoded form.  The majority of modern e-mail systems 
handle the conversion automatically, other users will need to run 
the UUdecode program for their particular system. If your e-mail 
system does not UUENCODE automatically, you will get back a bunch 
of gibberish starting with something like "begin 600 PWAE98.TIF" 
See your system administrator if you have any questions on this 
topic. UUdecode freeware and shareware may also be found on the Web, 
but the easier solution is to try a different e-mail system if that 
option is open  to you. The UUencoding process can add 0 to >100% 
overhead depending on your system and the type of file. 

Files which are greater than approximately 400KB in length may be 
sent as multiple e-mails which must then be appended to another and 
UUdecoded. This can be avoided using the "size" command following 
the "open" statement, e.g. "size 1000000." The maximum allowable is 2MB.  

Files sizes for NWS radiofax graphic files average 35KB but can be 
much greater especially some satellite images which can approach 1MB.
Use the "dir" command to ascertain the size of files of interest 
as a precaution.  Users should be aware of the costs for operating 
their particular e-mail system before attempting to use FTPMAIL, 
especially when using satellite communication systems.  For marine 
users,  using FTPMAIL via INMARSAT-C for obtaining current NWS 
radiofax graphic files is cost prohibitive.   Using the FTPMAIL 
compression feature of FTPMAIL is not recommended as these files 
are already in a compressed T4(G4) format enveloped in TIFF for 
viewing. You will need a graphics program capable of displaying 
files in this format in order to view them.  Suggestions for TIFF 
viewers may be found in file  http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/fax/rfaxtif.txt

Make certain you have not enabled any auto-reply function in your email 
system.

If you see the following response and believe your script to be correct,
the most likely  problem is that you are sending your e-mail in HTML 
format rather than the required plain text format.  

<FTP EMAIL> response
ftpmail has failed to queue your request with an error of:
	Must have an 'open [site [user [pass]]]'


Problems have been reported by users of Hotmail. (This may now be fixed) 

If you restrict incoming e-mail as a means of preventing spam, you
must program your e-mail system to allow messages from:
NWS.FTPMail.OPS@noaa.gov

The majority of error messages have been disabled.   You may or may
not receive an error message back from FTPMAIL if your script is in
error.

FTPMAIL problems are occasionally encountered when embedded control
characters are received within the e-mail message received by the 
FTPMAIL server.  These control characters may be introduced by the 
user's e-mail system and may be unavoidable. 

Also be certain that each of your commands does not have any leading
and/or trailing space(s) or you may see an error message with a number 
of statements saying "=20" 

Problems may also be encountered in trying to go down several levels
of directories simultaneously, e.g. "cd data/forecasts/marine/test".
Use a series of commands "cd data", "cd forecasts", "cd marine" instead.
In both these instances, the likely error will be "Directory not Found"

If the FTPMAIL server is too busy, you will receive an e-mail with a 
subject line similar to: "ftpmail job queuing for retry queue/097095.69568"
Your request will be resubmitted automatically and your requested 
file(s) should be received within several hours.
