The (G4)/TIFF format is used because the facsimile charts are in BLACK &
WHITE and other encoding formats generate significantly larger files.
The suggested TIFF viewers listed here are to help in your selection and
have been found to work in viewing these charts in past testing.  The
viewers and sources listed imply no endorsement by the NWS.
